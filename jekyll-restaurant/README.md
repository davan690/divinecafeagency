# Jekyll-restaurant with RMarkdown extensions

Showing how one could use Jekyll as an easy CMS for a restaurant website. 

As an R programmer I am looking at developing this structure further to incorperate RMD files and other key aspects that help leverage R capabilities without directly changing much of the template structure.
- ADDED BONUS: hosting on github is a world of help.

# Deploying

Deploying is done by editing the info in `_config.yml` in your own fork. To fork the project try the following instructions developed from Beautiful Jekyll (another great blog template from Dean)

## MUST DOs

- Change aspects in `./_config` file
- Don't forget to change the `CNAME`
- Setup the github structure you would like

# Posting

Posting can be done with the MrHyde app, or the github site. This will only work if the site is on GitHub, so that's preferred.

You can make new blog posts by addig a new file like `2015-09-14-Title.md`, change the menu and other info in `_config.yml`, change colour variables in `_sass/_variables.scss` (don't do this if you don't know what you are doing).

# License

Always ask permission to me ([mail](mailto:hello@haroen me) is fine) before using.
